# Sales-Analytics-UK-Online-Retail-Case-Study
This project analyzes 10,000 transactions from a public **UK Online Retail** dataset to extract **key business insights**.   

#  Dataset
- **Source:** [Kaggle – Online Retail Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lakshmi25npathi/online-retail-dataset)
- **Rows used:** First 10,000 records for faster exploratory analysis.

 # Key Findings

- **Revenue is highly concentrated:** Around 20% of products bring in about 80% of the total revenue. The top-selling items are:
  - Paper Chain Kit 50’s Christmas  
  - Rotating Silver Angels T-Light Holder  
  - White Hanging Heart T-Light Holder  

- **Strong seasonal effect:** Christmas-related products make up a large share of the top sellers. This shows clear demand peaks before the holiday season, so stocking up early could boost sales.  

- **Product focus:** It’s better to keep high-revenue products (Class A) in stock all year. Low-revenue products (Class C) could be reduced to save on inventory space and costs.  

- **Customer potential:** If the full dataset is analyzed, we can apply RFM segmentation to find high-value customers and target them with promotions.
